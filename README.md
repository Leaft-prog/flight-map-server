This program simulates flight data compatible with ASXi mobile.
It simulates an accelerated 10 minutes flight and all destinations are included.

For now there are bugs and still platform (a system used to control ASXi) isn't implemented yet, just flight data, so you get an error
that platform discovery has failed and  flight data isn't available (despite it actually is) but the moving map is shown as it should.

Some code was made by ai (most of these parts are just formulas and calculations as I don't have any knowledge in aviation lmao and some weird logic).

This program is made purely for fun and research purpose, please don't sue me.
